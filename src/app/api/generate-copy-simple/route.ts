üö® CAMPAIGN CONTEXT OVERRIDE:
The campaign notes provide detailed content requirements that must be fully addressed.

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: Campaign content takes precedence over default length settings.
- Create as many blocks as needed to properly cover all content mentioned in the campaign notes
- If the notes mention multiple items (reviews, products, features, etc.), ensure each gets adequate treatment
- Prioritize thorough coverage over rigid block count limits
- The goal is comprehensive content that matches campaign requirements

CONTENT-DRIVEN APPROACH:
- Let the campaign context dictate the necessary length
- Create enough blocks to properly address all mentioned content
- Don't artificially limit content if more blocks are needed for completeness
- Quality coverage of campaign requirements > arbitrary block limits
` : `EMAIL LENGTH TARGET:
${length === 'short' ? 'üéØ Create 5-8 focused content blocks.' : 
  length === 'long' ? 'üéØ Create 12-15 comprehensive content blocks with detailed sections.' :

üö® CRITICAL DIFFERENTIATION RULES:
- This email must feel COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from other emails in the flow
- Do NOT use generic "why choose us" or "quality/performance" content unless specifically required for THIS email's theme
- Do NOT repeat themes, messaging, or content structure from other emails
- Focus EXCLUSIVELY on this email's unique strategic role: ${flow_context.uniqueFocus || 'Unique strategic focus'}

FLOW-SPECIFIC STRATEGY:
${getFlowSpecificInstructions(flow_context)}

` : ''}EMAIL FLOW STRATEGY - Follow these universal principles for ANY campaign:

üö® CRITICAL: Include a CTA within the first 3-4 blocks (above the fold)

UNIVERSAL FLOW PRINCIPLES:
1. HOOK: Start with attention-grabbing benefit/value (1-2 blocks)
2. EARLY ACTION: Place first CTA within blocks 3-4 (above the fold)
3. AMPLIFY: Build desire with details, proof, features (blocks 5-7) 
4. URGENCY: Create time-sensitive reason to act (blocks 8-10)
5. FINAL PUSH: Strong closing CTA with clear next step

STRATEGIC GUIDELINES:
- Lead with the strongest benefit/value proposition
- Support claims with credibility (reviews, testimonials, social proof)
- Create multiple conversion opportunities (early + final CTA)
- Build urgency without being pushy
- Each block should advance the sale or build desire

BLOCK SEQUENCING RULES:
- Never bury the first CTA below block 4
- Group related content (don't jump between unrelated topics)
- Place social proof near the products/claims it supports
- Save strongest urgency for the end sequence
- Always end with clear, specific action

PRODUCT BLOCK STRATEGY - Every product must have INTENTION:
üö® CRITICAL: Each product block must have a clear strategic purpose and narrative reason

PRODUCT POSITIONING OPTIONS:
1. SINGLE HERO: Focus on one main product throughout the email
2. PRODUCT CHOICE: "Choose your adventure" - different products for different needs
3. PRODUCT PROGRESSION: Entry-level ‚Üí Premium upsell with logical transition
4. PRODUCT BUNDLE: Related products that work together

PRODUCT INTRODUCTION RULES:
- Never introduce products without setup/context
- Explain WHY this product (what problem does it solve?)
- If multiple products, clearly differentiate their purposes
- Use subheaders to set up product introductions
- Examples:
  ‚úÖ "CHOOSE YOUR FALL ADVENTURE" ‚Üí JoyRide vs Paradise
  ‚úÖ "READY FOR LONGER EXPEDITIONS?" ‚Üí Upsell transition
  ‚úÖ "THE COMPLETE TOURING SETUP" ‚Üí Bundle positioning
  ‚ùå Random product appearance after unrelated content

EVERY BLOCK TEST: Ask "Why is this here? What job does it do in converting the reader?"

FOR SPORTS/OUTDOOR BRANDS INCLUDE:
- Product benefits (based on provided context only)
- Performance themes (without specific claims unless provided)
- Social proof concepts (without fabricating specific testimonials)
- Multiple product features (using general language unless specifics provided)
- Professional usage themes (without making up specific endorsements)
- Event/achievement themes (only if mentioned in campaign notes)

‚ö†Ô∏è CONTENT RULES:
- DO NOT invent specific product specifications, prices, or technical details
- DO NOT create fake athlete names, race results, or testimonials  
- DO NOT make specific performance claims without context support
- DO use general themes like "trusted by professionals" instead of "used by Team XYZ"
- DO use placeholder language like "Ask [contact] for [specific asset]" for images/details
- DO focus on brand voice and messaging themes from the provided context

BLOCK TYPES TO USE:
- "header": Compelling headlines (punchy, under 60 characters)
- "subheader": Section dividers and supporting headlines
- "body": Detailed content paragraphs (can be comprehensive for sports content)
- "pic": Image placeholders with specific instructions (e.g., "Ask Timmy for race photos")
- "cta": Call-to-action buttons with link URLs  
- "product": Product spotlight blocks with title, description, CTA text, and link

OUTPUT FORMAT - Respond with ONLY valid JSON (no backticks, no markdown):
{
  "subject_lines": [
    "Compelling Subject Line 1",
    "Alternative Subject Line 2", 
    "Third Option Subject Line"
  ],
  "preview_text": [
    "Engaging preview text option 1",
    "Alternative preview text 2",
    "Third preview option"
  ],
  "email_blocks": [
    {
      "type": "header",
      "content": "COMPELLING HEADLINE"
    },
    {
      "type": "body", 
      "content": "Detailed paragraph content..."
    },
    {
      "type": "pic",
      "content": "Image description and sourcing instructions"
    },
    {
      "type": "cta",
      "content": "BUTTON TEXT",
      "link": "https://brand-website.com/product-url"
    },
    {
      "type": "product", 
      "content": "Product Name",
      "description": "Product description and benefits...",
      "cta": "SHOP PRODUCT",
      "link": "https://brand-website.com/product-url"
    }
  ]
}

Create email copy that matches the quality and detail level of professional sports marketing campaigns. Be specific, engaging, and conversion-focused.

‚ö†Ô∏è FINAL REMINDER: Use ONLY the provided context. Do not invent product specifications, athlete names, race results, or specific claims. When in doubt, use general language and placeholder instructions like "Ask [contact] for [specific details]".
